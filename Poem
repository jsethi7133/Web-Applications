     <h1>Not marble nor the gilded monuments (Sonnet 55)</h1>
     <p>Not marble nor the gilded monuments<br>
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme;<br>
But you shall shine more bright in these contents<br>
Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.<br>
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<br>
And broils root out the work of masonry,<br>
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn<br>
The living record of your memory.<br>
'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity<br>
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room,<br>
Even in the eyes of all posterity<br>
That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br>
    So, till the judgment that yourself arise,<br>
    You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.</p>
